									<p>The pursuit of knowledge has always been the primary motivation in my life. With a particular interest in social phenomena, 
										I chose to pursue a degree in sociology, where I discovered my passion for data analysis. Subsequently, specializing in Web Crawling 
										professionally allowed me to successfully address the common challenge of data availability. In my career, 
										I have worked as both a Marketing Analyst and Data Analyst, leveraging my skills in data analysis to derive insights 
										and drive strategic decision-making.</p>

										in my Job as a Data Analyst and Marketing Analyst. Each one will be described in terms of its objectives and key outcomes,

												<h4><b>Master Thesis: </b><br>
													The correct interpretation of logistic regressions. 
													A summary and application of the research practice by analyzing the determinants of unemployment.</h4>
												<p><b>Abstract: </b>Over the last few decades the effect sizes Logits and Odds Ratios from logistic
													regression models were criticized for being difficult to use and hard to understand.
													Additionally they seem to be biased by the unobserved heterogeneity and therefore
													can't be interpreted as stable predictors for binary dependent variables or compared
													between groups. Instead it was recommended to use linear predictors like the AME or
													a different regression model like the LPM. But those also showed distortions. As a first
													step towards providing clarity this master thesis summarized the entire statistical
													theory and the current research regarding the logistic regression. The second step
													consisted of applying the correct usage on the empirical example of the determinants
													of unemployment. The models were theoretically based on the human capital theories
													and used their data from the ALLBUS survey of 2012. Interpretations of their outcome
													as well as the comparisions between effects were done in context of the model
													specification and focused on the model fit measurements. Additionally the AMEs and
													the LPM were used for comparing the effect sizes between different groups and the
													results between different models. Odds Ratios and AMEs corresponded to each other.
													The LPM however showed a worse model fit and partly different results.</p>

												<h4>Social Media Marketing performance studies</h4>
												<p>With the market research company research tools, I regularly conduct Social Media Performance studies on the top 100 Social Media 
													advertisers in a given industry. The platforms investigated are Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, X, and YouTube. 
													Utilizing Web Crawlers, I gather data, including detailed information on approximately 40,000 posts published within a year. 
													Metrics such as followers, posts, shares, various elements of the posts in absolute numbers, as well as their sums and rates 
													across Social Media Account are analyzed. An overall ranking consolidates performance evaluations across the six platforms, 
													while a correspondence analysis visualizes the positioning of companies. These insights reveal the significant 
													Social Media platforms in the industry, the posts generating the most interactions, the most active companies 
													and those demonstrating the most efficient marketing practices based on follower growth and interactions. 
													The <a href="https://github.com/AndreM92/Social_Media_Crawler_2024" target="_blank">Social Media Crawlers</a>  
													and Python programs for data cleansing and statistical analysis are up to date for the latest study on supplements.</p>

												<h4>Research paper on the topic:<br>
													The correlation between Authoritarianism and Anti-Semitic thought structures among Sociology students.</h4>
												<p><b>Abstract: </b>This study extends the existing scales about Antisemitism and Authoritarianism to test 
													their correlations through a student survey. The categories to be tested are "Secondary Antisemitism", 
													"Antizionism" and "Structural Antisemitism" as modern forms of Anti-Semitic thinking structures 
													in relation to "Authoritarian Submissiveness", "Conventionalism" and "Authoritarian Aggression". 
													In addition to the Right-wing Authoritarianism scale, this study also develops a Left-wing 
													Authoritarianism scale based on political ideologies. The collection and analysis of data takes place 
													in context of a research Seminar at the FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg. A correlation model shows that Right-wing 
													Authoritarianism is correlated with the Antisemitism Index. Apart from that there are no connections 
													between the Antisemitism Index and Left-wing Authoritarianism or political attitude. When classifying 
													Antisemitism into the above mentioned subcategories there appear to be connections between the Right-wing 
													Authoritarianism, secondary Antisemitism and Antizionism as well as between Left-wing authoritarian 
													Submissiveness and structural Antisemitism.</p>
